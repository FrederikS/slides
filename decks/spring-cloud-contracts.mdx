# Spring Cloud Contracts

---

## What?

- facilitates contract testing approach
- verifies integration between applications within your system
- contracts define integration points between producer and consumer
- supports multiple DSL for contract definitions (Groovy, Java, Kotlin, YAML)

---

## How?

- generates HTTP/messaging stubs for client/consumer development, doing exactly
  what the actual server/producer implementation does
- provides a way to publish changes in contracts, immediately visible in both
  sides
- generates boilerplate test code, used for verification of the server/producer
  implementation

---

## Why?

- very fast feedback
- no infrastructure required
- promotes ATDD (acceptance test-driven development) in microservice-based
  architectural style

## REST API Example

## Contracts

```yaml
description: Represents a successful scenario of getting a list of foo
request:
  method: GET
  url: /foo
  headers:
    Accept: application/json
response:
  status: 200
  bodyFromFile: response.json
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  matchers:
    body:
      - path: $[*].bar
        type: by_regex
        predefined: non_blank
```
